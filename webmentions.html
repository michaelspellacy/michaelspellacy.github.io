title: Webmentions
---

<p>To respond to one of my posts on your own website, enter the URL of your response which should contain a link to the post's permalink URL. Your message will then appear as a response on the post you are responding to. This is called webmention and they are a really cool way to allow websites to communicate with one another.</p>

<p>If you want to update or remove your response, then change or delete your post and re-enter your post's URL again. That's all there is to it!</p>
