<p>I have seen colleagues get a little confused while attempting to create infographics, so this is an effort to clear things up.</p>

<p>Often, requests are put through to produce "HTML infographics". However, what is being asked for here is not an infographic, but just a regular ol' webpage. Infographics serve a particular purpose and are usually meant to be easily shared across social media.</p>

<p>I also see multiple inforgarphics created, one for mobile users and one for desktop users, usually in an attempt to improve cross-device viewing, but this is not ideal, as a single image should only be created to be shared. That's it! Oh, and let's not forget about accessibility. If you do handle it right, there are ways to accomodate everybody. Anyway, please read on, and by all means, share my inforgraphic about infographics!</p>
