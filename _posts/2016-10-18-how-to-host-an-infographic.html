<p>I have seen colleagues get a little confused while attempting to create infographics, so this is an effort to clear things up. Often, requests are put through to produce "HTML infographics". However, these are not infographics, but just regular web pages. HTML is not where you want to be producing your infographics. Infographics are meant to be, ya know, graphics. I also see multiple inforgarphics created, one for mobile users and one for desktop users in an attempt to improve readability, but this is also an incorrect way to implementation infographics. A single image is to be created and shared across social space. That's it! Oh, and let's not even discuss accessibility, which is all but forgotten. Anyway, please read on, and be all means, share my inforgraphic about infographics!</p>
