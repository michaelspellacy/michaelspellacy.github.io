<p>I have seen colleagues get a little confused while attempting to create infographics, so this is an effort to clear things up.</p>

<p>Often, requests are put through to produce "HTML infographics". However, what is being asked for here is not an infographic, but just a regular webpage. HTML is not where you want to be producing your infographics. Infographics are meant to be, ya know, graphics. Designers make them and hand them off to developers to be implemented.</p>

<p>I also see multiple inforgarphics created, one for mobile users and one for desktop users, usually in an attempt to improve cross-device readability, but this is also an incorrect way to implement them. A single image is to be created and shared across social space. That's it! Oh, and let's not even discuss accessibility, which is all but forgotten. Anyway, please read on, and by all means, share my inforgraphic about infographics!</p>
