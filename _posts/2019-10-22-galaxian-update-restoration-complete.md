Behold! I have officially finished the Galaxian last month! Isn&#39;t it glorious? Eventually, I&#39;ll get around to writing a detailed post about the restoration of this cabinet, but for the time being, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/WSSfYPSoPKM52WKr7&quot;&gt;check out some photos&lt;/a&gt; of the process from start to finish. Enjoy!

Next Up: Pac-Man!
