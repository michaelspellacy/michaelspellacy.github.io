I finally got around to adding webmention support to this site, which is simple to do through a third-party service called [webmention.io](https://webmention.io).

Essentially, I can now engage with other websites in the same manner one might engage with other users on a social media platform, but instead of the siloed, walled garden experience within an app, like Twitter, I can communicate and engage with other sites that also support webmentions and can even carry on conversations with users on several social media platforms, which is wicked cool. I really like the #indieweb scene. 

Next up, I need to display webmentions on articles and notes I publish. [Andy Bell went through this journey already](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/adding-webmentions-to-my-personal-site/), so I will try to read up on it some more and implement soon.
