<p>So I made this thing. Clients and colleagues often ask me for "video hero banners". I guess they are really sexy and engaging or something. While desktop is never <em>usually</em> an issue, I have often recommended alternative experiences for mobile to avoid performance issues. Static image fallback usually, and on rare occasions&mdash;a carousel to stand in as a video banner, which may be even worse than just loading a video on mobile to begin with, as you now have to maintain <em>two</em> different experiences, which is very messy to do. So I asked myself, what if we could create a video banner that was more performance friendly (and accessible, of course)? Maybe it could even be similar to the <code>picture</code> element? Initially, I checked to see if the <code>video</code> element supported the <code>media</code> attribute, so that I could load different video sources at different viewport widths, but this turned out not be supported in browsers, so I had to roll my own with JavaScript (Plain Vanilla). Turns out it is not that hard to do! Here is what I did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Used <code>matchMedia</code> to toggle the value of the <code>video</code> element's <code>src</code> attribute at different screen widths.</li>
  <li>Added pause functionality that sticks from page to page. If movement is troubling to an individual, then that is something they will probably want to eliminate on all pages throughout a site.</li>
  <li>Added support for <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>. Here we are using <code>matchMedia</code> to detect this user preference.</li>
</ul>

<p>Behold the fruits of my labor! I give you the <a href="/video-hero-banner/">Video Hero Banner</a>!

<p>Yes, I know it is not a very original name, but what can I tell you? Naming things is hard sometimes!</p>
