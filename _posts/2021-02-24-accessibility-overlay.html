<p><a href="https://shouldiuseanaccessibilityoverlay.com">The answer is no, of course.</a></p>

<p>The impetus for this little page came from answering this question at work on a fairly regular and alarming basis, so I thought it might be nice to succinctly answer the question in a manner that colleagues and stakeholders could easily digest and share. I and many others in the web design industry see overlays as a danger to disabled people and to accessibility and inclusion overall, so having a simple resource to answer it seemed like a pretty good idea.</p>

<p>I post this with special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jared_w_smith">Jared Smith</a>, who inspired me with his website, <a href="https://shouldiuseacarousel.com/">Should I Use A Carousel?</a> and to the disabled and web communities for really ralling around it and sharing it far and wide. It was very gratifying to see.</p>
