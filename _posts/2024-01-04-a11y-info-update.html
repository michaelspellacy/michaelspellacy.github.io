<p>Hi all! I am faced with having to make a hard decision about <a href="https://a11y.info">a11y.info</a>. The costs for it are rising and I am currently paying $30 dollars a month to keep it going. I was going to ask for donations, but as of late, I do not have the time to maintain it like it I once did, so it may just be easier for me to shut it down. If this is the case, you will all have adequate time to migrate to another instance. Not a problem.</p>

<p>Before we go there though, if there is any interest in keeping it going, I would be happy to hand off the reigns to the right individual or individuals, so please reach out. You'll need to be a little tech savvy and, of course, committed to accessibility.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your understanding.</p>
