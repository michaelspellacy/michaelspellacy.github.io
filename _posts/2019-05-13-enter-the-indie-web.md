I have been spending a lot of time lately, exploring the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>. I dig the idea of owning my online presence and content. I will post more as I learn about it, but today I was able to get IndieAuth and Micropubs working on this site, which is run via Jekyll (GitHub Pages). I'm pretty happy with it so far. Next up are Webmentions. That looks hard.
