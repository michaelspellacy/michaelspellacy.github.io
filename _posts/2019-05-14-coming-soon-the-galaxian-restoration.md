This is the arcade cabinet that I am currently restoring. Isn&#39;t it lovely? I used to pump so many quarters into these things! I hope to finish it this summer, so expect a lot of detailed posts about it in the coming months! If you think it looks bad now, you should have seen it a few months ago!
