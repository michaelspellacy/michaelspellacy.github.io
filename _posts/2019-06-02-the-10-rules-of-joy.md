My daughter, Joy, has some rules for all you people, so you had better get with it!  Especially if you are boy!

1. Girls only
2. Every girl is allowed to draw in this notebook.
3. We don&#39;t like boys
4. Girls rule
5. Boys drool
6. I&#39;m a girl
7. I&#39;m not a boy
8. Girls are the best
9. Boys are the worst
10. Girls rock and boys smell

Damn straight, Joy.
