Well here is the next big restoration, folks! I picked it up a couple of weeks ago. It was originally a Pac-Man, which was converted to a Pac-Man Jr. and I&#39;ll be taking it back to its original Pac-Man glory. The goal is to do this one on a tight budget. I have already made some modifications to it and it is in much better condition than the Galaxian, so hopefully it won&#39;t break the bank. 

Did you all know that I got into arcade restoration to help deal with depression? It&#39;s true. I need to keep my mind busy, so it defiently helps. Anyway, stay tuned for more exciting updates!
