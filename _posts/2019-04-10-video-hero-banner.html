<p>So I made this thing. Clients and colleagues often ask for video hero banners. In the past, I have recommended alternatives for mobile. Static images, usually, to avoid the performance hit, but what if we could create a video banner that was more performance friendly (and accessible, of course)? Maybe even similar to the <code>picture</code> element? Turns out we can! Behold the fruits of that labor! I give you the...<a href="/video-hero-banner/">Video Hero Banner</a> (say this with an echo).</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
