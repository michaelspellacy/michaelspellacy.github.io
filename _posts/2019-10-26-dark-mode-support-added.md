Did you know that websites support dark mode, too? It&#39;s true. All the cool kids are doing it, so I peppered in a little support tonight. Turn it on in your settings or wait for your battery power to drain. Just another great way to make our sites more accessible!

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {

... your styles here ...

 }
```
