The original artwork on the Super Pac-Man bezel (the glass over the monitor) was ruined by last owner and faded due to years of exposure to direct sunlight, so I decided to scrape it off and replace it with new vinyl, compliments of [EscapePod](https://www.escapepodonline.com/collections/bezels/products/super-pac-bezel?variant=14787995334), who make very nice reproductions. Sad that the original artwork can&#39;t be saved, but this is how it goes sometimes.
