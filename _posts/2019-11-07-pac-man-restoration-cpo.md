Got the new Control Panel Overlay (CPO) last week. It looks good, but is ever so slightly off from the original. Likely something no other human-being will notice, but which screams out to my anal retentive eyeballs.

Soon I will disassemble the control panel, clean everything, resolder if need be, strip, spray, apply new CPO and reassemble.

I&#39;ll be doing this to most other parts on the machine first, before working on the cabinet itself. So far, I&#39;m still within budget.

I also replaced the plug. My son walked into the office a few days ago, barefoot, and started receiving low level shocks from the machine itself. Something I had not noticed before, because I always have sneakers on. Sure enough, the  outlet was missing a third prong and that was the culprit. Fun with electricity!
