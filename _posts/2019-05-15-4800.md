Nice post here about `prefers-reduced-motion`, which I have also been using more and more often. In addition to CSS, don&#39;t forget that you can do it in JavaScript, too.

``const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia(&#39;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&#39;);
mediaQuery.addEventListener(&#39;change&#39;, () =&gt; {
  console.log(mediaQuery.media, mediaQuery.matches);
  // Stop JavaScript animation
});``
