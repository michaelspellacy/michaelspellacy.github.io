Saw another Pac-Man listed on Facebook Marketplace. The cabinet is in great condition and the price was right, so I could not pass it up. It does not appear to be working at the moment, so I will have to troubleshoot that. I drove to Lancaster, PA to aquire it, which is about 90 minutes from my home. Such is my mania. 

This will be my primary Pac-Man, and likely will not take much work to get it where I want it. The other one I picked up in September will definitely be restored, but I&#39;m going to take that cabinet in an exciting direction, so stay tuned...
