title: About Me

<p>Wow, so you really want to know more about me, eh? Okay, here goes...</p>

<p>I work for <a href="https://www.tmp.com/">TMP Worldwide</a>, a global recruitment ad agency. I have held many development and manageneet positions over the years, but the one I am most proud of is becoming TMP's very first Director of Accessibility.

<p>The first time I saw HTML, way back in 1996, I literally fell in love. The web was something I needed to be a part of and contribute to. Every job or new position I have held was a stepping stone to were I am today. For 15 of those years with TMP, I worked out of their headquarters in New York City, but now work remotely from beautiful Allentown, PA. Making inclusive products and websites and teaching others how to do the same is my absolute passion!</p>

<p>When I am not focused on accessibility, I am a devoted family man who enjoys hanging out with my awesome wife and our spectacular five children, so my life is never boring. For those moments whene I do have a little time on my hands, I can be found <a href="{% link arcade.html %}">restoring old arcade cabinets</a> to their formy glory!</p>
