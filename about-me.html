title: About Me
---

<p>Wow, so you really want to know more about me, eh? Cool, here goes...</p>

<p>I work for <a href="https://radancy.com">Radancy</a>, an independent technology company that provides SaaS (Software as a Service) for recruitment and talent acquisition. I've held various development and management positions over the years, but the one I am most proud of is becoming Radancy's very first Director of Accessibility—a role I've held for a decade.</p>

<p>The first time I encountered HTML, way back in 1996, I literally fell in love. The web was something I needed to be a part of and contribute to. Every job or new position I’ve held has been a stepping stone to where I am today. For 15 of those years with Radancy, I worked out of their headquarters in New York City, but I now work remotely from beautiful Allentown, PA. Making inclusive products and websites, and teaching others to do the same, is my absolute passion! Occasionally, I do consult, so feel free to reach out if you have an inquiry or are looking for more guidance on digital accessibility.</p>

<p>When I'm not focused on accessibility, I'm a devoted family man who enjoys spending time with my amazing wife and our five fantastic children. When I do have a little downtime, I can often be found tinkering with various technologies, working on this blog, or <a href="{% link arcade.html %}">restoring old arcade cabinets</a> to their former glory!</p>
